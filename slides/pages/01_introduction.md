# Problem Overview
- Improve food security, safety, and agility through enhanced agricultural traceability initiatives in Australia.
- Create and prototype an Agri Food Product Passport utilizing the AATP framework.
- Utilize Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) alongside Verifiable Credentials for secure data management.

<!-- The primary challenge we're tackling today is the issue of food security and safety within the agricultural sector in Australia. The idea is to build a system that ensures the food that arrives at our tables is safe, efficiently managed, and traceable throughout the supply chain. <br/><br/> We're aiming to prototype an Agri Food Product Passport, leveraging the AATP framework—essentially creating a digital identity for agricultural products. <br/><br/> By using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials, we're ensuring the data remains secure and verifiable, which ultimately contributes to greater trust in the system from producers, distributors, regulatory bodies, and consumers alike. <br/><br/>Think of this passport as a comprehensive digital record for food items—one that captures every key event from production to distribution, providing insights that enhance both food safety and the efficiency of agricultural processes.-->

# Approach and Solution
- Utilize Decentralized Identity (DI) based W3C verifiable credentials.
- Implement Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for secure data management.
- Leverage open-source tools for system implementation.
- Demonstrate the capability to issue product credentials.
- Verify product credentials effectively.
- Establish a Decentralized Identity (DI) wallet for users.
- Create a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR) to ensure data integrity.
- Ensure food security through a product passport system.
- Provide safety and agility with conformity credentials.
- Enable traceability for specific products or batch identifiers.

<!-- Our approach revolves around adopting Decentralized Identity standards that are based on W3C verifiable credentials. This means that each agricultural product will have verifiable credentials associated with it, similar to digital IDs we use for humans. <br/><br/>We use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to securely manage these data interactions, ensuring that every transaction or product update is trustworthy and tamper-proof. <br/><br/>We’re also making use of open-source tools to keep the system transparent and collaborative, allowing contributions from a broader developer community. <br/><br/>This is important for scalability and maintaining security standards. <br/><br/>We will demonstrate how product credentials can be issued and verified, ensuring each product can be traced back through its life cycle. <br/><br/>Additionally, the establishment of a DI wallet allows users to access product credentials easily. The Verifiable Data Registry (VDR) ensures data integrity by recording all key events in the product's journey.<br/><br/>Essentially, with these measures, we not only enhance food security but also provide a robust, secure mechanism for data management throughout the agricultural supply chain.-->

### Product Vision: Develop a prototype of the AATP-enabled Agri Food Product Passport that leverages Decentralized Identity (DI) based W3C verifiable credentials and Decentralized Identifiers to enhance food security, safety, and agility in Australia. 

This will be achieved through the issuance and verification of credentials, establishment of a DI wallet, and creation of a verifiable data registry (VDR) to ensure comprehensive traceability for agricultural products.

<!-- The product vision focuses on developing a prototype for the AATP-enabled Agri Food Product Passport, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Decentralized Identity and W3C verifiable credentials. <br/><br/> This vision is about giving each food product its own unique digital identity—a secure and transparent way to track its entire journey from production to the consumer’s table. <br/><br/> This includes the issuance of verifiable credentials at each critical stage, ensuring authenticity. We’re also building a DI wallet where all these credentials can be stored and accessed securely by users. <br/><br/> Imagine it as a wallet full of digital certificates for each step of the agricultural product’s lifecycle. Finally, a verifiable data registry (VDR) will be created to store this information in a secure and immutable manner. <br/><br/> This comprehensive approach guarantees that all relevant information remains tamper-proof and accessible, ultimately enhancing food security, product safety, and operational agility in the agricultural supply chain.-->
