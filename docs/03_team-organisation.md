# Team organisation

## Team Overview
The team consists of students interested about advancing their technical and programming skills, particularly in the fields of software engineering, computer science, IT, and IS. Each team member will play a specific role in the project to ensure its successful completion. [2]

### Arpita Dhar
Project lead and System designer, responsible for the overall system design and overseeing project progress. She ensures timely completion, coordinates with the team, and manages internal communication to address issues. 

### Gaurav Singh
API developer and Student liaison, tasked with designing and implementing the Passport and VDR API for the prototype. He demonstrates the functionality through the DI wallet and maintains project documentation.

### Prathap Reddy K
Serves as the API security analyst, ensuring API security by implementing robust protocols, conducting risk assessments, and protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.

### Sheikh Ashik Rahman Elahi
Quality Assurance Analyst, responsible for creating comprehensive test plans that outline the testing scope, objectives, resources, and timelines. He designs and develops test cases based on software requirements and specifications to validate functionality, performance, and security. He also runs unit testing during product development and executes test cases manually or using automated testing tools to identify defects. Additionally, he generates reports on test results, defect metrics, and overall software quality to stakeholders, helping them make informed decisions.

### Jins Alias
User Experience Designer, focused on designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for user-facing components of the project. He tests to ensure alignment with stakeholder needs and conducts usability testing to refine the user experience. He also creates comprehensive documentation for the user interface, ensuring consistency and accessibility across the platform.

### Albin Johny
Database Administrator (DBA), ensures Data Standards and Interoperability. His role involves setting up and managing the database to store Verifiable Credentials. While the actual DIDs and credentials are managed in a decentralized manner, the database holds essential metadata such as issuance dates, expiration dates, associated entities (e.g., issuing authority), and status indicators (e.g., active, revoked). This ensures that the data within the system is consistent, reliable, and can be easily shared across different platforms and stakeholders in the supply chain. Additionally, his role includes implementing cybersecurity and data privacy measures to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the data stored in the system. This involves robust security protocols such as encryption, access control mechanisms, and regular security audits to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, or any form of tampering.

## Organisational structure
- To effectively organize our student team for the WIL project, we have structured it to align with the various roles and responsibilities required to meet our project objectives.
- Each team member has chosen specific tasks that correspond to their strengths and areas of expertise, ensuring a balanced workload and clear accountability.
- Our team structure not only facilitates internal collaboration but also establishes direct links with external groups, such as faculty advisors and client.
- The diagram below illustrates our internal team divisions.

## Communication

### Communication Channels
-  **Internal and external communication:** We have chosen MS TEAMS as the common and single space for all project related communication.
-  **Team meetings:** We also use MS TEAMS for meetings with client and have pre-scheduled weekly meetings every Friday.
-  **Question handling:** We will use MS TEAMS workspace to ask questions or any project related communication.

### Decision Making
-  **Decision Process:** Decisions will be made through consensus, but in cases of disagreement, the project manager will facilitate a discussion to reach a final decision.
-  **Technical Decisions:** The lead developer will have the final say on technical and software development matters.
-  **Project Direction:** The project manager will make the final decisions on project scope, timeline, and external communication.

### Conflict Management
-  **Conflict Resolution:** Address conflicts through open discussion, mediated by the project manager if necessary.
-  **Underperformance:** If a team member consistently underperforms, a one-on-one meeting will be conducted to discuss issues and offer support or reassign tasks.
-  **Unprofessional Behaviour:** Unprofessional behaviour will be addressed immediately with a private conversation, and if unresolved, escalated to the faculty advisor or relevant authority.

### Task/Progress Management
-  **Progress Tracking:** We use a dedicated channel called 'Progress Tracking' within MS TEAMS to track tasks, deadlines, and deliverables.
-  **Handling Delays:** If delays occur, tasks will be reassigned, and the team will work extra hours if needed to meet the assessment deadline. The project manager will also communicate with external stakeholders to manage expectations.
