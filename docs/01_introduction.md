# Introduction

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance Australia's agricultural traceability initiatives to improve food security, safety, and agility. The primary goal is to design and implement a prototype of the Australian Agricultural Traceability Protocol (AATP)-enabled Agri Food Product Passport [1]. This prototype will utilize Decentralized Identity (DI) based W3C verifiable credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, leveraging open-source tools. The system will demonstrate the capability to issue and verify product credentials, establish a DI wallet, and create a verifiable data registry (VDR). Ultimately, this project seeks to ensure food security, safety, and agility through a product passport system with conformity credentials and traceability for specific products or batch identifiers.

## Resources and Facilities
The prototype will be built on personal laptops owned by the team members along with remote servers that might be required as we develop the prototype/underlying system; in case of more resources, we may use the computer programming labs at Griffith university.
